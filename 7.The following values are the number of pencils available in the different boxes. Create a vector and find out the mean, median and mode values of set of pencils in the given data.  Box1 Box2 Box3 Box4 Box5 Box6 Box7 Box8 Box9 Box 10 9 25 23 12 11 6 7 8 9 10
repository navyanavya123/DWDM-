# Given data
pencil_counts <- c(9, 25, 23, 12, 11, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

# Calculate mean
mean_pencils <- mean(pencil_counts)

# Calculate median
median_pencils <- median(pencil_counts)

# Calculate mode
mode_pencils <- names(table(pencil_counts))[table(pencil_counts) == max(table(pencil_counts))]

# Output the results
cat("Mean:", mean_pencils, "\n")
cat("Median:", median_pencils, "\n")
cat("Mode:", mode_pencils, "\n")
